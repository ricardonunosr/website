<title>Ricardo Nuno - Tool Services I use </title>
<main>
  <h1 id="tools-services-i-use">Tools Services I use</h1>
  <p>I got the inspiration to write this because of this <a
      href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/tools-I-like">article</a>.</p>
  <p>Something that I really connected with the article I mentioned above is the minimal config/using defaults. There is
    nothing bad in customizing to fit your needs but I just don’t like to think I can only work optimally if I have this
    3 million lines of config files on <a href="https://github.com/ricardonunosr/dotfiles/">my dotfiles repository</a>
    managed by an ansible script…</p>
