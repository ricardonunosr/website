# Tools Services I use
I got the inspiration to write this because of this [article](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/tools-I-like).

Something that I really connected with the article I mentioned above is the minimal config/using defaults. There is nothing bad in customizing to fit your needs but I just don’t like to think I can only work optimally if I have this 3 million lines of config files on [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ricardonunosr/dotfiles/) managed by an ansible script…

## Coding

- Zsh with zsh-autosuggestions, I just like the minimal config I have with this setup and have everything that I like.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), search your terminal history easily
- [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/), awesome Hex editor

## Browsing

- uBlock origin, awesome adblocker
- Dark Reader, dark mode baby
- Firefox, great browser I also use the Sync feature just for the bookmarks

## Misc

-   [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), I use this website for every drawing I need to do
-   [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), I dump every link, every task, every thought… in my obsidian vault
-   iPhone Cloud storage 50 gb (cheap af)-> 1 euro/month
    -   photos
    -   contacts
    -   phone settings

-   [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), using the dropbox mainly to store some files about my financial stuff and other things. It just works which is really nice :)
