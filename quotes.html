    <blockquote>
        <p>”Much reading after a certain age diverts the mind from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and
            uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking, just as the man who spends too much time
            in the theaters is apt to be content with living vicariously instead of living his own life.” - Albert
            Einstein</p>

        <p>&quot;An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity” - Terry A Davis</p>

    <blockquote>
		<p>&quot;There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.&quot; - Phil Karlton</p>
